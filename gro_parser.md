# gro parser

## Project goal: 

Develop a parser for the gro programming language with focus on generating
equivalent smol\sbml (or other) markup representations.

## Learning Schedule

### weeks 5-8
- Learn gro syntax.
- see basic gro examples in practice (debugging simulator work).
- Begin to understand the way in which the gro simulator parses source code.
- Begin toying with flex and bison.

### weeks 9-12
- Intensive code review of the gro simulator.
- Define compiler software architecture.

### weeks 13-16
- Discuss about representability of the gro language on the smol\sbml formats.

## Release Schedule

### weeks 5-8
- Start introduction, refs and correlated work sections
- Examples of handcrafted gro -> markup syntax translations.
- Discuss article objectives.

### weeks 9-12
- Identify parsing methods based on gro simulator.
- ... to be defined.

### weeks 13-16
- Write conclusion section.
- Finish working kernel of the gro parser.
